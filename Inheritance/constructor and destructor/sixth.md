# The keyword virtual precedes the rest of the inherited class' specification

# Now that both derived1 and derived2 have inhertited base as virtual, any multiple inheritance involving them will cause only one copy of base to be present

# Therefore, in derived3 there is only one copy of base and obj.i = 10 is perfectly valid and unambiguous
